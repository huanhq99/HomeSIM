# MacCellular for macOS

This branch adds a native macOS service for the DJI Cellular Dongle / Quectel
EG25-G. It does not require UTM for AT-mode management.

## Current scope

- Automatic discovery of DJI (`2ca3`) and Quectel (`2c7c`) USB serial ports
- Modem, SIM, operator, registration and signal status
- Receive and send SMS through the modem AT port
- Execute explicit AT commands
- Read and switch physical eUICC profiles through AT APDU transport
- Local management page at `http://127.0.0.1:7576` in the MacCellular edition
- Packaged Universal release containing Apple Silicon and Intel binaries

The cellular data interface remains managed by macOS. This allows macOS to use
the dongle as its network connection while DJOneHub uses a separate USB serial
interface for management.

## Downloaded release

The Universal DMG contains the backend, SwiftUI App, libusb runtime, licenses,
installer and uninstaller. It does not require Go, Homebrew or a separately
installed libusb on the user's Mac. Open it and run
`安装 MacCellular.command`.

The CLI ZIP is installed separately. From the extracted ZIP directory:

```sh
./install
maccellular start
```

The terminal remains attached to the service and the management page opens
automatically. Press `Control+C` to stop it, or run `maccellular stop` from
another terminal. Logs are stored in
`~/Library/Logs/MacCellular/djonehub.log`.

## Build from source

Requirements:

- macOS 13 or newer
- Go 1.26 or newer

```sh
./scripts/build-dmg-universal.sh v1.0.0-rc.4
```

Release outputs:

- `dist/MacCellular-macOS-universal-v1.0.0-rc.4.dmg`
- `dist/MacCellular-macOS-universal-v1.0.0-rc.4.dmg.sha256`

The packaging script downloads the official libusb source archive, verifies its
SHA-256, builds it for macOS 13 or newer and bundles the resulting runtime.

## Run

Connect the modem and run:

```sh
./dist/djonehub-macos
```

If automatic discovery picks no AT port, inspect `/dev/cu.*` and pass it:

```sh
./dist/djonehub-macos -port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

The server only listens on localhost by default. Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7576
```

## Demo without hardware

To explore the management page before buying the module, run:

```sh
./dist/djonehub-macos -demo
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:7576`. Demo mode provides simulated modem status,
SMS messages, AT command responses and eSIM profiles. It does not access a real
SIM, send messages or switch a physical eSIM profile.

## Launch at login

The DMG installer registers the MacCellular-specific backend and App LaunchAgents.
Their logs are written to `~/Library/Logs/MacCellular`. The CLI ZIP does not
register LaunchAgents; start and stop it with `maccellular`.

## Platform limitations

- Native QMI/MBIM control, Linux udev and network-namespace orchestration are
  excluded from this macOS entry point.
- eSIM behavior depends on the physical eUICC and modem firmware. Profile
  switching must be verified with real hardware.
- The release uses an ad-hoc signature rather than an Apple Developer ID. On
  first run, macOS may require approval in Privacy & Security.
